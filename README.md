### Highlights

- [Swerve API](https://github.com/Greater-Rochester-Robotics/GRRBase/blob/main/src/main/java/org/team340/lib/swerve/SwerveAPI.java)

    Supports various hardware configurations, from vendors such as CTRE, REV, and Redux Robotics, with features such as high frequency odometry, a custom ratelimiter to improve driver control while also reducing wheel scrub, and built-in support for tuning the drivetrain's configuration live via NetworkTables.

- [Pre-defined Loggers](https://github.com/Greater-Rochester-Robotics/GRRBase/tree/main/src/main/java/org/team340/lib/logging)

    Utilizing Epilogue, an annotation-based logging framework, custom loggers for vendor and WPILib APIs are pre-defined to transparently log relevant data from the robot's hardware, without any extra setup required.

- [Various other utilities](https://github.com/Greater-Rochester-Robotics/GRRBase/tree/main/src/main/java/org/team340/lib/util)
